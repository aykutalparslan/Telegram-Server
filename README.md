Telegram Server is an open source, server side implementation of [Telegram API].

This project is currently being developed and only a small number of API calls work as this code is released at the beginning of the development. Some of the working parts are:

  - Creating an Authorization Key
  - SingUp, SignIn etc.
  - Sending Messages(incomplete)

Our MTProto implementation works but does not include many security checks necessary yet. Therefore it is not recommended for any other uses other than experimental use.
